#Emotion_Recognition with PyTorch!!!

#Project from #sg_caffeine_coders done individually.



# Project overview 
In this project I've taken a picle file which is a  collectiion of comments of people and classified the emotion out of them like sad, happy e.t.c.


# Approaches followed 

This is the pickel file I've used for the project: [FILE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15b9xdnvuq5DbMwyy13u55h8-qlNYTVn3/view?usp=sharing)



# Outcome of the project

1. First I could classify the Training comments with the =ir emotions e.g. Sadness, joy, love. 
here's the output of that [LINK](https://gyazo.com/aae5aaff5ee46b5d6f1b34b4a9625ac4)

2. then with the model I created I was able to get a training accuracy of 97.00 %

validation accuracy of 92.00 %

over 10 epochs!

and a test accuracy of 92.73 % for emotion classification.!!!!

### Here's the Workflow of my project!!!

![BlockDiagram of the Model](https://gyazo.com/1a0d5bd34ae1da546686df4ad1b604b2)

1. I've Designed my model by using a GRU(Gated Rrecurrent Unit) with a very traditional ReLU + Softmax for activation!!! 

From the model I could achieve: 

training accuracy of 97.00 %

validation accuracy of 92.00 %

and a test accuracy of 92.73 % for emotion classification.!!!!

2. Then I worked on the Confusion Matrix and the default Classifier report:

### Use case of my Emotion Dection Project:

Some use cases for my Emotion Detection Project are:

1. Emotion Detection of Drivers in Semi-Supervised Self Driving Cars, For making the cars Safer.

2. Facial Emotion Detection in Interviews

3. Testing for Video Games(for a specific Target Audience)

4. Market Research(tp find Consumer needs)

### Using Pytorch :

Yes I've used Pytorch for Building my Model in this Project!!!
