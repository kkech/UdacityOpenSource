# Federated_Learning_using_Pysyft_Pytorch

## Federated Learning 
     This is the repository for implementation of federated learning using 
     PyTorch and PySyft. The Skills I learnt from  Secure and Private AI Scholarship course
     offered by Udacity and Facebook.
     
## Objectives 

Since Federated learning is an exciting technique to learn on decentralized data so the objective of the reporistory is ***to introduce federated Learning and to show how it works.***

## About Federated Learning

Federated learning is a technique where a model can be trained without the need to move and store the training data to a central location.

## Applications of Federated Learning

- This technique is tightly connected to preserve the privacy of users. Many big companies start investing on this powerful technology.
- One of the popular application is ***Next Word Prediction using federated learning.***
- One can use federated learning framework for multi-party database querying without exposing the data. 
- Health care is an another domain which is greatly benifiting from this technique

## Acknowledgement

I would like to show my gratitude to ***Udacity and Facebook*** for providing me a chance. Three months in this Scholarship Challenge has made huge impact in my life in positive ways. Thank you for helping me to achieve my dreams. Last but not least, I would also like to acknowledge the efforts of slack community who is always ready to help.
