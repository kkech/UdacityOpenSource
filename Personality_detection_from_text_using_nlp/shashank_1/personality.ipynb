       "'I am worried about my brother, Bobby, right now. My mother just called me and told me he was in a bad car accident and was taken to the ER. She said he is okay, but they are stitching him up right now. Tonight I went to church with my best friend, Amanda. We sang a lot, which I love. I\\'m not necessarily the best singer, but I really enjoy it. All the songs we sang tonight, I knew from my church at home in Plano. That made me happy. I also signed up for teams at church. Right now I am a little frustrated though because Amanda and I are trying to do our Art History homework, but the website won\\'t let me download the article I need. Very Frustrating!!!  Oh, I need to go wash my dishes when I\\'m done with this. Amanda and I made chili-cheese dogs. They were great!!  My roommate, Sijia, is not home yet, and this worries me because it is pretty late, and she shouldn\\'t be walking around Austin alone in the dark. I have to write a paper for my freshman seminar class for Friday on two pieces of music that I have not been able to listen to yet, which frustrates me. I just found out about the assignment today. School is going well though, a little stressing, but all around, it is going well. All day I listened to one of the best songs I have heard in a long time called \"How Could I\". The music in this song is very well played, and the lyrics are really good (sad though), and the lead singer (of oleander)\\'s voice is very soft and pretty. I have to do a geology assignment for my discussion section tomorrow which is a little stressing because the article for the paper I have to write is about 20 pages long. I didn\\'t get much sleep last night because I was trying to read for Art History because I don\\'t learn anything in that class because it does not interest me at all. I woke up early this morning to look over my math homework. I won\\'t get much sleep tonight either. Amanda has music playing in the background right now, but I don\\'t know who is singing. I like the way it sounds though. Tonight I taught Amanda how to tap dance. It was interesting. we went into my bathroom (because it\\'s really big and has a good floor for tapping) and I taught her a few basics. She and I have both danced our entire lives, but she has never taken tap, so I am going to teach her. She is going to teach me pointe, because I haven\\'t done ballet in three years. I have a bad knee, and last summer I had knee surgery, so I haven\\'t been able to do very many classes the last few years. I only took tap and jazz. I miss ballet though. Since I\\'ve moved to Austin, I\\'ve really missed dance because I don\\'t have a dance studio here. I would like to go take some classes, but I think it would be better to concentrate on school, at least the first semester, and I can just practice at home. I bought new pointe shoes the other day. We had to walk many many miles to get them. Today in geology class, we played football and sang the UT fight song standing up with the \"hook \\'them\" sign in the air. It was a very interesting class. right now I wonder if anyone has IMed me on AIM. I\\'m really tired, but I won\\'t be able to sleep tonight because I need to do school work. My parents might go to the Bahamas in a few weeks, hopefully I may go as well. I haven\\'t been to a beach in two summers now because of the knee surgery and rehab (for the knee), and this summer we were just too busy. That reminds me, I miss my family in Virginia. Maybe I can fly out there this summer. That would be fun. Virginia is beautiful. The Chesapeake area especially. I\\'m glad my brother is alright, but when my mother called it worried me. But he will be fine. I cleaned the guest bathroom tonight (I have to do chores around the house because I live in a co-op). Tomorrow I think I\\'m going to sleep in between classes. I only have two discussion sections. Sijia just got home!!  '"

       "'I am worried about my brother, Bobby, right now. My mother just called me and told me he was in a bad car accident and was taken to the ER. She said he is okay, but they are stitching him up right now. Tonight I went to church with my best friend, Amanda. We sang a lot, which I love. I\\'m not necessarily the best singer, but I really enjoy it. All the songs we sang tonight, I knew from my church at home in Plano. That made me happy. I also signed up for teams at church. Right now I am a little frustrated though because Amanda and I are trying to do our Art History homework, but the website won\\'t let me download the article I need. Very Frustrating!!!  Oh, I need to go wash my dishes when I\\'m done with this. Amanda and I made chili-cheese dogs. They were great!!  My roommate, Sijia, is not home yet, and this worries me because it is pretty late, and she shouldn\\'t be walking around Austin alone in the dark. I have to write a paper for my freshman seminar class for Friday on two pieces of music that I have not been able to listen to yet, which frustrates me. I just found out about the assignment today. School is going well though, a little stressing, but all around, it is going well. All day I listened to one of the best songs I have heard in a long time called \"How Could I\". The music in this song is very well played, and the lyrics are really good (sad though), and the lead singer (of oleander)\\'s voice is very soft and pretty. I have to do a geology assignment for my discussion section tomorrow which is a little stressing because the article for the paper I have to write is about 20 pages long. I didn\\'t get much sleep last night because I was trying to read for Art History because I don\\'t learn anything in that class because it does not interest me at all. I woke up early this morning to look over my math homework. I won\\'t get much sleep tonight either. Amanda has music playing in the background right now, but I don\\'t know who is singing. I like the way it sounds though. Tonight I taught Amanda how to tap dance. It was interesting. we went into my bathroom (because it\\'s really big and has a good floor for tapping) and I taught her a few basics. She and I have both danced our entire lives, but she has never taken tap, so I am going to teach her. She is going to teach me pointe, because I haven\\'t done ballet in three years. I have a bad knee, and last summer I had knee surgery, so I haven\\'t been able to do very many classes the last few years. I only took tap and jazz. I miss ballet though. Since I\\'ve moved to Austin, I\\'ve really missed dance because I don\\'t have a dance studio here. I would like to go take some classes, but I think it would be better to concentrate on school, at least the first semester, and I can just practice at home. I bought new pointe shoes the other day. We had to walk many many miles to get them. Today in geology class, we played football and sang the UT fight song standing up with the \"hook \\'them\" sign in the air. It was a very interesting class. right now I wonder if anyone has IMed me on AIM. I\\'m really tired, but I won\\'t be able to sleep tonight because I need to do school work. My parents might go to the Bahamas in a few weeks, hopefully I may go as well. I haven\\'t been to a beach in two summers now because of the knee surgery and rehab (for the knee), and this summer we were just too busy. That reminds me, I miss my family in Virginia. Maybe I can fly out there this summer. That would be fun. Virginia is beautiful. The Chesapeake area especially. I\\'m glad my brother is alright, but when my mother called it worried me. But he will be fine. I cleaned the guest bathroom tonight (I have to do chores around the house because I live in a co-op). Tomorrow I think I\\'m going to sleep in between classes. I only have two discussion sections. Sijia just got home!!  '"
