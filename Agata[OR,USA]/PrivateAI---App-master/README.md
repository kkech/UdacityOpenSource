# PrivateAI---App

PrivateAI—App was born as a showcase project based on knowledge gained during Secure and Private AI Scholarship Challenge from Facebook. It’s my way of helping others to learn about preserving user privacy.  

**PrivateAI** it’s an Android App that will test your knowledge of three cutting-edge technologies for privacy-preserving AI: 
- Federated Learning
- Differential Privacy
- Encrypted Computation

Are you ready? Then fasten your seatbelt and let’s get started :smile:
