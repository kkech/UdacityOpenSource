Simple chatbot based on requerence sequence to sequence model 
and has been trained on movie scripts 


The chatbot has been currently trained 
and will chat  

here is the sample chat which is an output from the model 
==================================
Run the code using python model.py 
==================================
and a ">" appears where you can type your comments and the bot will reply 
press q to quit
----------------------------------


> hi there you go
Bot: hi . you re a good boy .
> heheehe
Error: Encountered unknown word.
> okay pal
Bot: okay . ! ! ! !
> cya
Error: Encountered unknown word.
> see ya
Bot: see you later . again .
> go to go
Bot: go home ! ! ! !
> you go first
Bot: i m sorry .
==================================
===================================




Project is not completed, I need to implement the federated learning and secure learning part where chat scripts from different clients are collated and secured instead of using a movie scripts.
