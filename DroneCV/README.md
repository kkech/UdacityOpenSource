# SPAIC-DroneCV
How can you use a drone to track objects or people and what would be the use case for this implementation?
Throughout the weeks the team of the Drone Tracking study group have researched use cases, implemented tutorials and tried to find information how to integrate federated learning and differential privacy with a drone.

### Key Accomplishments

* Object tracking with OpenCV
* Colour tracking
* Object tracking with PyTorch
* Added code to a drone for object detection
* Authored articles & tutorials for Computer Vision with Drones

### Use Case
Our team considered many possible use cases for a drone that could follow a target, which are discussed in the wiki page "Use Cases" within this github repo.  Initially, we considered the safety benefits of a drone following a person with a health condition such as epilepsy, dementia, or a serious heart condition as they move through public space.  We also considered the benefits for atheletes to have a drone follow them as they train, possibly recording data about the route, pace, terrain, and performance to develop personalize training programs.  But, ultimately, we decided to focus on the use case of Rescue at Sea because it holds great potential for positive impact.

Our team has unique insight into this dangerous situation... 

### Drone CV- Rescue at Sea (Helena's insights)

Having worked at sea as a mechanic for the first part of my professional life I have been trained in safety at sea. 
When we started working with our DroneCV project we thought of different use cases for a drone that could track people or an object. One of the use cases was:

“A drone could be helpful to follow and localize people at sea. A drone connected to a ship or sailboat could be helpful in case of emergency and keep track of people falling overboard or/and detect them if the ship sinks.”

If ships had rescue drones onboard these could be used in case of man overboard. Even a calm day with almost no waves it is very hard to detect someone that has fallen overboard from a ship. If someone fell overboard a rescue drone could be sent out to track that person in the water and function as a beacon for the rescue crew. It could also drop a life west or a float for the person in the water. 
This rescue drone could also be used from shore. It could work as an additional help for life guards along the beaches.

We have demonstrated the tracking of people (superheroes) in water through this YouTube video with real drone footage:
- [Drone tracking a ship and people (superheroes) overboard](https://youtu.be/MBKmas-Z4_c) (no superheroes were harmed in the making of this video)

The object tracking is implemented in PyTorch and the code can be found [here](https://github.com/jess-s/SPAIC-DroneCV/tree/master/PyTorch_Objecttracking)

The drone used for the video is a [Heron Drone](https://www.kjell.com/se/produkter/hem-kontor-fritid/fritid/dronare-quadrocopter/dronare-med-kamera/heron-dronare-med-kamera-p51107?gclid=CjwKCAjw7uPqBRBlEiwAYDsr12AkBzrjregM2xXXO8sEZm3WuRMCH2uPEM7TDnVz154f1I0E8ZwcrRoCKwsQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)
***
During research after selecting this use case, we discovered that it had  been selected as an [AI for Social Good Workshop at neurIPS](https://aiforsocialgood.github.io/2018/pdfs/track2/50_aisg_neurips2018.pdf) in 2018 which supports the value of this use case.
