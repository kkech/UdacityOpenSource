## Real Time Object Detection Using Pytorch
This project is an attempt, to implement Real Time Object Detection using Yolo v3 and OpenCv and Pytorch from scratch. The aim is to create an android app which can be used to detect object in real time with an option to detect specific object from within the set of images or video, and maybe on later stages use the object to reverse search the internet for information and facial recognition.
