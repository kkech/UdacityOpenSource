Two people were working on this concept: Mariia Denysenko and Olimjon Ibragimov

Idea: 
AI tool, which using analysis of a given textual data, generates a strong password, that would be easy for a given individual to remeber. 
For further details please refer to the Jupyter notebook. 

P.S.: the project name is a reversed and rotated word "password".
