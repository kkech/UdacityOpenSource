# Showcase Project

This repo contains a Jupyter notebook which I developed as part of Udacity & Facebook's Secure & Private AI Challenge showcase project.

# Abstract

This is an attempt to generate a benchmark analysis between Traditional Deep Learning & Encrypted Deep Learning.
Although successful training and testing was achieved for the traditional methodology, the encrypted approach was not yet successful.
Until August 30th, I will continue pushing for a successful end to this work.
Despite this setback, I am presenting the work as-is, as I am proud of the evolution I achieved over the past 3 months.

# Dependencies

The project requires the PySyft library in order to run. This library may be installed using the following conda commands:

conda create -n pysyft python=3

conda activate pysyft

conda install jupyter notebook
