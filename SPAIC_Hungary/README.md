## Udacity - Secure and Private AI Challenge Course - Hungarian team - 2019

This repository contains the project and memos of the Hungarian team.

## The Project

We planned and start realize a complex project: a FrontEnd solution (web page) + a VGG19 based style transfer model + take care on privacy issues. The user can upload his own image and set some parameters (choose style, beta etc) and can create a styled image. If the model recognizes a human face in the picture , the user should prove and claim that is his/her face - to gain the privacy .
