Fake News Detection in Binary and Six-way Classification
I'm one of the Facebook Secure and Private AI Scholar. I had done a project on Fake News Detection using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I had done Binary Classification and as well as six-way classification using different Machine Learning Classifiers they are


### 1.Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier

### 2.Passive Aggressive Classifier

### 3.Support Vector Classifier

### 4.Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier


By training and testing repeatedly I had got Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier is best for Binary Classification. And Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier is best for six-way classification.
My project was helpful in finding Fake News during elections or campaigns in Social Media or News Channels.

I had got this project by reading these research papers
