Fashion MNIST Classification

Fashion MNIST-

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images—consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Zalando intends Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.


Technology used - 

Fashion MNIST Classification uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

1)numpy - NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

2)pytorch - An open source deep learning platform that provides a seamless path from research prototyping to production deployment.

3)matplotlib - Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.

4)torchvision - The torchvision package consists of popular datasets, model architectures, and common image transformations for computer vision.

5)python - Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language

Requirments - 
1) python 3.6.+
2) Pytorch
