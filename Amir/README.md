# SECURE AND PRIVATE AI SCHOLARSHIP CHALLENGE SHOWCASE PROJECT - AMIR

## WEB APP PROJECT IS ABOUT - SAFE AI EMAIL SPAM/HAM MODELLING AND PREDICTION

# @inspired by Andrew Trask @iamtrask [blog](https://iamtrask.github.io/2017/06/05/homomorphic-surveillance/)

# Homomorphic Encryption use one of its alogorithm Paillier Cryptography For Model and Prediction Encryption

## Learn More About [Homomorphic Encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption) 

## Before Homomorphic Encryption

- people can see predictions and modify it as per their requiement to false others, predictions get Faked 

- people can modify the trained model weights which is a steal, public model will be reverse engineered


## After Homomorphic Encryption

- people cannot modify as preditions is now encrypted

- people cannot modify the trained weights as model is now encrypted
