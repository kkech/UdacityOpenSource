# APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection

Detect diabetic retinopathy to stop blindness before it's too late

This is a Kaggle ongoing Kaggle competition which I found really interesting. Imagine being able to detect blindness before it happened.

## Dataset:

Millions of people suffer from diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness among working aged adults. Aravind Eye Hospital in India hopes to detect and prevent this disease among people living in rural areas where medical screening is difficult to conduct. Successful entries in this competition will improve the hospital’s ability to identify potential patients. Further, the solutions will be spread to other Ophthalmologists through the 4th Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society (APTOS) Symposium

Currently, Aravind technicians travel to these rural areas to capture images and then rely on highly trained doctors to review the images and provide diagnosis. Their goal is to scale their efforts through technology; to gain the ability to automatically screen images for disease and provide information on how severe the condition may be.

The goal is to build a machine learning model to speed up disease detection working with thousands of images collected in rural areas to help identify diabetic retinopathy automatically. If successful, we will not only help to prevent lifelong blindness, but these models may be used to detect other sorts of diseases in the future, like glaucoma and macular degeneration.

Instructions to run the code:
The language used is Python3. Libraries used: 

● Numpy

● Pandas

● Scikit-learn

● Pytorch

● Syft



## Steps to run the code:
	Just run the IPython notebook

The goal of the project was to use the knowledge acquired in a real dataset. The goal was to used Pytorch for transfer learning where I used Resnet50 and used syft. The dataset is aninymised dataset but as we discussed in the course that anonymisation is not the secure way. So, this was a pefect dataset to delve into according to be and use it for using what I learned
