Title of the Project - Chatbot as a service using Secure Multiparty Computation

Short Description of the Project - Chatbots provide a cost effective alternative to organizations for providing customer service. Organizations across a particular industry for e.g. banks could provide their chatbot model as a service as well as share their customer service interaction data with other organizations. To enable this kind of sharing however, a mechanism has to be there which allows both the chatbot model owner and the dataset owner to protect their model's IP and the privacy of their data respectively. OpenMined's PySyft library provides such a mechanism using constructs for Secure Multi-Party Computation which provides a mechanism to enable computation on encrypted data, enabling organizations to securely share their chatbot model and their customer service interaction data with other organizations.
