# facedetect
E-voting system based on face authentication


team members:- @Ayushi Gupta  and @Aakanksha Dhurandhar


We have designed a system to verify voter identity from face recognition,comparing with the photograph in the Voter ID and get the details through aadhar card.

Login of voter will be through aadhar number and otp send on his/her registered mobile number. Face recognition of voter is done through instant image taken by system through camera and comparing with voter id and aadhar photo.
Voter can vote from anywhere in a fixed time. Tallying of votes is done automatically thus saving time and thus no middle man required and hence curbing bogus votes.
