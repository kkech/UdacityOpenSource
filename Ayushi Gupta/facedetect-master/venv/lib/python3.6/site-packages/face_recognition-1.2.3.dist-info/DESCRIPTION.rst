Face Recognition
================

| Recognize and manipulate faces from Python or from the command line
  with
| the world's simplest face recognition library.

| Built using `dlib <http://dlib.net/>`__'s state-of-the-art face
  recognition
| built with deep learning. The model has an accuracy of 99.38% on the
| `Labeled Faces in the Wild <http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/>`__
  benchmark.

| This also provides a simple ``face_recognition`` command line tool
  that lets
| you do face recognition on a folder of images from the command line!

Features
--------

Find faces in pictures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Find all the faces that appear in a picture:

|image3|

.. code:: python

    import face_recognition
    image = face_recognition.load_image_file("your_file.jpg")
    face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)

Find and manipulate facial features in pictures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Get the locations and outlines of each person's eyes, nose, mouth and
chin.

|image4|

.. code:: python

    import face_recognition
    image = face_recognition.load_image_file("your_file.jpg")
    face_landmarks_list = face_recognition.face_landmarks(image)

| Finding facial features is super useful for lots of important stuff.
  But you can also use for really stupid stuff
| like applying `digital
  make-up <https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/digital_makeup.py>`__
  (think 'Meitu'):

|image5|

Identify faces in pictures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Recognize who appears in each photo.

|image6|

.. code:: python

    import face_recognition
    known_image = face_recognition.load_image_file("biden.jpg")
    unknown_image = face_recognition.load_image_file("unknown.jpg")

    biden_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(known_image)[0]
    unknown_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(unknown_image)[0]

    results = face_recognition.compare_faces([biden_encoding], unknown_encoding)

You can even use this library with other Python libraries to do
real-time face recognition:

Usage
-----

Command-Line Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| When you install ``face_recognition``, you get a simple command-line
  program
| called ``face_recognition`` that you can use to recognize faces in a
| photograph or folder full for photographs.

| First, you need to provide a folder with one picture of each person
  you
| already know. There should be one image file for each person with the
| files named according to who is in the picture:

|known|

Next, you need a second folder with the files you want to identify:

|unknown|

| Then in you simply run the command ``face_recognition``, passing in
| the folder of known people and the folder (or single image) with
  unknown
| people and it tells you who is in each image:

.. code:: bash

    $ face_recognition ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/

    /unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,Barack Obama
    /face_recognition_test/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,unknown_person

| There's one line in the output for each face. The data is
  comma-separated
| with the filename and the name of the person found.

| An ``unknown_person`` is a face in the image that didn't match anyone
  in
| your folder of known people.

Adjusting Tolerance / Sensitivity
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

| If you are getting multiple matches for the same person, it might be
  that
| the people in your photos look very similar and a lower tolerance
  value
| is needed to make face comparisons more strict.

| You can do that with the ``--tolerance`` parameter. The default
  tolerance
| value is 0.6 and lower numbers make face comparisons more strict:

.. code:: bash

    $ face_recognition --tolerance 0.54 ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/

    /unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,Barack Obama
    /face_recognition_test/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,unknown_person

| If you want to see the face distance calculated for each match in
  order
| to adjust the tolerance setting, you can use ``--show-distance true``:

.. code:: bash

    $ face_recognition --show-distance true ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/

    /unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,Barack Obama,0.378542298956785
    /face_recognition_test/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,unknown_person,None

More Examples
'''''''''''''

| If you simply want to know the names of the people in each photograph
  but don't
| care about file names, you could do this:

.. code:: bash

    $ face_recognition ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/ | cut -d ',' -f2

    Barack Obama
    unknown_person

Speeding up Face Recognition
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

| Face recognition can be done in parallel if you have a computer with
| multiple CPU cores. For example if your system has 4 CPU cores, you
  can
| process about 4 times as many images in the same amount of time by
  using
| all your CPU cores in parallel.

If you are using Python 3.4 or newer, pass in a
``--cpus <number_of_cpu_cores_to_use>`` parameter:

.. code:: bash

    $ face_recognition --cpus 4 ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/

You can also pass in ``--cpus -1`` to use all CPU cores in your system.

Python Module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| You can import the ``face_recognition`` module and then easily
  manipulate
| faces with just a couple of lines of code. It's super easy!

API Docs:
`https://face-recognition.readthedocs.io <https://face-recognition.readthedocs.io/en/latest/face_recognition.html>`__.

Automatically find all the faces in an image
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

.. code:: python

    import face_recognition

    image = face_recognition.load_image_file("my_picture.jpg")
    face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)

    # face_locations is now an array listing the co-ordinates of each face!

| See `this
  example <https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/find_faces_in_picture.py>`__
| to try it out.

You can also opt-in to a somewhat more accurate deep-learning-based face
detection model.

| Note: GPU acceleration (via nvidia's CUDA library) is required for
  good
| performance with this model. You'll also want to enable CUDA support
| when compliling ``dlib``.

.. code:: python

    import face_recognition

    image = face_recognition.load_image_file("my_picture.jpg")
    face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image, model="cnn")

    # face_locations is now an array listing the co-ordinates of each face!

| See `this
  example <https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/find_faces_in_picture_cnn.py>`__
| to try it out.

| If you have a lot of images and a GPU, you can also
| `find faces in
  batches <https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/find_faces_in_batches.py>`__.

Automatically locate the facial features of a person in an image
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

.. code:: python

    import face_recognition

    image = face_recognition.load_image_file("my_picture.jpg")
    face_landmarks_list = face_recognition.face_landmarks(image)

    # face_landmarks_list is now an array with the locations of each facial feature in each face.
    # face_landmarks_list[0]['left_eye'] would be the location and outline of the first person's left eye.

| See `this
  example <https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/find_facial_features_in_picture.py>`__
| to try it out.

Recognize faces in images and identify who they are
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

.. code:: python

    import face_recognition

    picture_of_me = face_recognition.load_image_file("me.jpg")
    my_face_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(picture_of_me)[0]

    # my_face_encoding now contains a universal 'encoding' of my facial features that can be compared to any other picture of a face!

    unknown_picture = face_recognition.load_image_file("unknown.jpg")
    unknown_face_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(unknown_picture)[0]

    # Now we can see the two face encodings are of the same person with `compare_faces`!

    results = face_recognition.compare_faces([my_face_encoding], unknown_face_encoding)

    if results[0] == True:
        print("It's a picture of me!")
    else:
        print("It's not a picture of me!")

| See `this
  example <https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/recognize_faces_in_pictures.py>`__
| to try it out.

      :name: how-face-recognition-works

| If you want to learn how face location and recognition work instead of
| depending on a black box library, `read my
  article <https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-part-4-modern-face-recognition-with-deep-learning-c3cffc121d78>`__.

Caveats
-------

-  The face recognition model is trained on adults and does not work
   very well on children. It tends to mix
   up children quite easy using the default comparison threshold of 0.6.

Deployment to Cloud Hosts (Heroku, AWS, etc)
--------------------------------------------

| Since ``face_recognition`` depends on ``dlib`` which is written in
  C++, it can be tricky to deploy an app
| using it to a cloud hosting provider like Heroku or AWS.

| To make things easier, there's an example Dockerfile in this repo that
  shows how to run an app built with
| ``face_recognition`` in a `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`__
  container. With that, you should be able to deploy
| to any service that supports Docker images.

Common Issues
-------------

Issue: ``Illegal instruction (core dumped)`` when using
face\_recognition or running examples.

| Solution: ``dlib`` is compiled with SSE4 or AVX support, but your CPU
  is too old and doesn't support that.
| You'll need to recompile ``dlib`` after `making the code change
  outlined
  here <https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/issues/11#issuecomment-287398611>`__.

Issue:
``RuntimeError: Unsupported image type, must be 8bit gray or RGB image.``
when running the webcam examples.

Solution: Your webcam probably isn't set up correctly with OpenCV. `Look
here for
more <https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/issues/21#issuecomment-287779524>`__.

Issue: ``MemoryError`` when running ``pip2 install face_recognition``

| Solution: The face\_recognition\_models file is too big for your
  available pip cache memory. Instead,
| try ``pip2 --no-cache-dir install face_recognition`` to avoid the
  issue.

Issue:
``AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'face_recognition_model_v1'``

Solution: The version of ``dlib`` you have installed is too old. You
need version 19.7 or newer. Upgrade ``dlib``.

Issue:
``Attribute Error: 'Module' object has no attribute 'cnn_face_detection_model_v1'``

Solution: The version of ``dlib`` you have installed is too old. You
need version 19.7 or newer. Upgrade ``dlib``.

Issue: ``TypeError: imread() got an unexpected keyword argument 'mode'``

Solution: The version of ``scipy`` you have installed is too old. You
need version 0.17 or newer. Upgrade ``scipy``.
