Childhood Autistic Spectrum Disorder Screening using Machine Learning

The early diagnosis of neurodevelopment disorders can improve treatment and significantly decrease the associated healthcare costs. In this project, we will use supervised learning to diagnose Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) based on behavioural features and individual characteristics. More specifically, we will build and deploy a neural network using the Keras API.

This project will use a dataset provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository that contains screening data for 292 patients. The dataset can be found at the following URL: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Autistic+Spectrum+Disorder+Screening+Data+for+Children++
