# Flower classification tutorial project.

In this project I used a deep learning model, the VGG16, to classify flower images.

I used a pre-trained model and the powerful tools from pytorch to learn from flower image data and then classify flowers.


## Project Steps:

* Loading and preprocessing image dataset

* Training image classifier on my dataset

* Using the trained classifier to predict image content


## Packages and Frameworks Used .

1. Matplotlib. 

2. Numpy

3. Torch

4. Torchvision.

5. Json


## Dataset 

I used the iris flowers dataset and explored itâ€™s structure using statistical summaries and data visualization. The dataset is available here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data


## Model Training and Classification

The entire process and my code is available in a notebook on google collaboratory, which is available here: https://colab.research.google.com/github/nancyalaswad90/60daysofudacity/blob/master/Image_Classifier_Project.ipynb


## Outcomes and Observations

I used this project to strengthen my understanding of Deep Learning, and sharpen my skills with Pytorch. This project showed how Pytorch makes Deep Learning convenient and easy.


## Future 

After what I was able to do, I hope to go deeper into Deep Learning, and use it to solve world problems.
